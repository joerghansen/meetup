Getting started with Boost Multi-Index

== What is it?

* Part of the Boost libraries since version 1.32
* Boost Software License, Version 1.0
* Header-only library
* Provides `multi_index_container`, a special data structure for storing objects

== Multi indexing?

* Borrowed from relational database terminology
* Storage of complex objects managing multiple _indices_ with different sorting and access semantics

== Intermezzo

Some live coding...

== Some index types

* `sequenced`
** non key-based
** works like `std::list`

* `random_access`
** non key-based
** works like `std::vector`

== More index types

* `ordered[_non]_unique`
** key-based, ordered
** works like `std::[multi]set`

* `hashed[_non]_unique`
** key-based, hashed
** works like `std::unordered_[multi]set`

== Key extraction

* Identity
* Member
* `[const_]mem_fun`
* `global_fun`
* User defined
* Composite keys

== Work with indexes

* Access to objects in container via index
* Operations may fail due to clashing with other indices
* *Important:* Objects are immutable
* Modification through member functions `replace` and `modify`
* Move between indices with `project`
